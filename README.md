*Overview:*

- Given a polygon on the map, calculate demographics.

- The user can use the "marker" tool (upper left corner) to click on the map or type in location information into the search box to specify a location.
- Only locations within the United States are supported.
- A 3 minute isochrone (drive-time) polygon is then calculated using Route360 REST Services and is subsequently displayed onto the map.  
- Demographic informaton that is calculated within the isochrone polygon is also displayed.  2010 Census Block data is used for the calculation and uniform distribution of data is assumed.
- Click the '?' icon on the webpage for more information.
